### Hi! 👋

I'm Parker, a computer science graduate in California🌴. I like to work on applications that further develop my skills and serves a purpose that favors me.
I like to primarily use programming languages</> like C#, Java, Python, and HTML but I occasionally use others. I use applications🛠️ like Figma, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ to build my applications.
I have worked on a couple of different projects🗂️ but I reccomend looking at the repositories that I have pinned. My favorite⭐ project is my [Oasis Prototype](https://github.com/Parkerjames02/Oasis-Prototype-WPF.git) that I made with C# in using the WPF .NET framework.
I am currently working👷 on the official refined version of Oasis and can't wait to develop more applications in the future.
