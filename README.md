## Hi! 👋

I'm Parker, a computer science graduate in California.

I like to work on applications that further develop my skills and serves a purpose that favors me.

I like to primarily use programming languages like C#, Java, and HTML but I use many others.

I use applications like Figma, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ to build my applications.

I have worked on a couple of different projects but I reccomend looking at the repositories that I have pinned.

My favorite project is my Oasis Prototype that I made with C# in using the WPF .NET framework.

I am currently working on the official refined version of Oasis and can't wait to develop more applications in the future.
